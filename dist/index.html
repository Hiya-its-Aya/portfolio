            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p> Hi, I'm a budding developer based in California, with a current emphasis on front-end Web Development. I graduated with a BS in Mathematics in May 2021, and in the time between then and now, I have been discovering what career path was best for me, and eventually, all signs pointed to a carrer in software deveolpment. I enjoy problem-solving and dedication that I have retained from my degree, but wanted to apply my skills to something more tangible. I also want to take my love for creating accessible materials that I grew from my Disabilities Services job at Fresno State into my work. I am currently learning web development with The Odin Project, fullstack Javascript path, where I have already made more than a dozen small projects on my own. I think, despite being a novice, I will be a great addition to any team and learn fast.</p>
